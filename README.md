## FlowNet2 (TensorFlow)
能够处理任意尺寸的输入
This repo includes FlowNetC, S, CS, CSS, CSS-ft-sd, SD, and 2 for TensorFlow. Most part are from this [repo](https://github.com/sampepose/flownet2-tf), and we have made some modifications:
* It can deal with arbitrary size of input now.
* After installation, just copy the whole folder `FlowNet2_src` to your codebase to use. See `demo.py` for details.

### Environment
务必使用Tensorflow1.2的环境
This code has been tested with Python3.6 and TensorFlow1.2.0, with a Tesla K80 GPU. The system is Ubuntu 14.04.

### Installation

You must have CUDA installed: `make all`

**Note:** you might need to modify [this line](https://github.com/vt-vl-lab/tf_flownet2/blob/master/Makefile#L13), according to the GPU you use.

### Download weights
To download the weights for all models (4.4GB), run the `download.sh` script in the `FlowNet2_src/checkpoints` directory. All test scripts rely on these checkpoints to work properly.


### Inference mode

```
python demo.py
```

If installation is successful, you should see the following:
![FlowNet2 Sample Prediction](/FlowNet2_src/example/0flow-pred-flownet2.png?raw=true)

Notice that the model itself will handle the RGB to BGR operation for you. And please be care about your input scale and datatype.

### Performance (w/o fine-tuning)

| Model       | KITTI2012 Train EPE     |  KITTI2015 Train EPE     |  KITTI2015 Train F1     |  Sintel Final Train EPE |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| FlowNetS       | 7.2457     |  14.0753     |  0.5096     |  3.9140     |
| FlowNetC       | 5.9793    |  11.8957     |  0.4509     |  3.1001     |
| FlowNet2       | 4.3167     |  10.9869     |  0.3241     |  2.1592     |

FlowNetS and FlowNetC are better than paper, but FlowNet2 is slightly worse.

### TODO
* Add fine-tune mode
* Remove the `training_schedule` variable from inference mode.
